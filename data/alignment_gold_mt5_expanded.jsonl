{"input_text": "explain: What is a cache miss? Give an easy analogy.", "target_text": "A cache miss happens when the fast storage doesn't have what you need, so the system fetches it from a slower source. Example: you check your desk drawer, it's not there, so you go to the storage room to get it."}
{"input_text": "explain: Cache miss kya hota hai? Ek easy analogy do.", "target_text": "Cache miss tab hota hai jab fast storage mein required cheez na mile, phir system ko slow source se lana padta hai. Example: desk drawer mein file nahi mili to aap store room se laate ho."}
